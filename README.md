# trash-docker-viewer-and-control-python
A trash docker viewer / controller half made by me and the other half made by chatgpt. It's a cool client to use but keep in mind it does not encrypt your password if you save a profile

Requisitos:

python -m pip install PyQt5 paramiko

Not a very good client, I was just bored and I wanted a tool to view my dockers using SSH, that's all
